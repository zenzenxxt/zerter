# Safe Exam Browser (SEB) Configuration File - EXAMPLE INSTRUCTIONS
# This file provides guidance on how to create your ACTUAL `exam-config.seb` file
# using the SEB Configuration Tool (available from safeexambrowser.org).
#
# You MUST create your actual `exam-config.seb` file using the SEB Configuration Tool.
# Then, place that generated `exam-config.seb` file into your project at:
#   public/configs/exam-config.seb
# And ensure it's deployed with your application.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CRITICAL: Start URL Configuration within your ACTUAL .seb file
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# When configuring your `exam-config.seb` file using the SEB Configuration Tool:
#
# Set the "Start URL" to:
#   https://YOUR_APP_DOMAIN/seb/entry
#
# - Replace `YOUR_APP_DOMAIN` with the actual, publicly accessible domain where your
#   ZenTest application is deployed (e.g., `https://proctorx.netlify.app`).
# - DO NOT include any hash parameters like `#entryToken=...` or query parameters
#   like `?examId=...` directly in this Start URL setting *within the SEB Config Tool*.
#
# How it works:
# 1. Your ZenTest application (from the regular browser) will launch SEB using a
#    URL like: `sebs://YOUR_APP_DOMAIN/seb/entry/GENERATED_UNIQUE_TOKEN`
# 2. This URL tells SEB to open its browser directly to your application's
#    `/seb/entry/[token]` page.
# 3. The `/seb/entry/[token]` page then handles token validation, system checks,
#    and exam loading.
#
# The `exam-config.seb` file you provide to students (or configure on machines)
# is primarily for enforcing security settings (blocked keys, processes, etc.)
# when SEB is active for your application, regardless of how it was started.
# If a student starts SEB by *opening* your `exam-config.seb` file directly,
# it will load the `Start URL` you configured (e.g., `https://YOUR_APP_DOMAIN/seb/entry`),
# but it won't have a token, so that page should ideally guide them to the login
# or join exam page of your main application.
# The application-initiated launch (`sebs://.../seb/entry/[token]`) is the primary flow.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Recommended Security Settings (Configure these in the SEB Configuration Tool):
#
# == General Tab ==
# Start URL: https://YOUR_APP_DOMAIN/seb/entry (Replace YOUR_APP_DOMAIN)
# Quit/Restart Password: Set a strong quit password if needed for controlled environments.
# Allow user to quit SEB: Check this, but also enable "Enable quit link (seb://quit)" below.
#
# == Config File Tab ==
# Administration Password: Set if you want to protect the config file from changes.
#
# == User Interface Tab ==
# Browser view mode: Use "Fullscreen Mode" or "Touch optimized" (without kiosk mode if not needed).
# Enable Reload button in SEB Task Bar: True (for network hiccups)
# Show SEB Task Bar: True
#   - Show reload button: True
#   - Show time: True
#   - Show keyboard layout: True (Optional)
# Enable "Exit SEB" button (or Quit Link): True. This should be `seb://quit`.
#   (This is often managed via `allowQuit` and specific key combinations or links)
#
# == Browser Tab ==
# Enable Browser Exam Key: True (Recommended for server-side validation if your LMS supports it - ZenTest API doesn't use it yet).
# Enable JavaScript: True
# Enable plugins: False (unless specifically needed)
# Block Pop-up Windows: False (Your app opens the exam in a new tab, ensure this doesn't interfere if SEB's interpretation is strict. Test this setting.)
#
# == Network Tab ==
# URL Filtering:
#   - Enable URL Filter: True (Recommended for higher security)
#   - Action for prohibited URL: Block
#   - Add your application's domain as allowed.
#     Example (adapt as needed for more complex filtering):
#     Rule 1: Action = Allow, Expression = `https://YOUR_APP_DOMAIN/*` (Replace YOUR_APP_DOMAIN)
#     Rule 2: Action = Block, Expression = `*` (This blocks everything else - put this last)
#
# == Applications Tab ==
# Prohibited Processes: Add common screen capture, communication, and remote desktop apps.
#   (Your provided XML snippet already has a good list, ensure those are in your config tool)
# Permitted Processes: Usually none, unless a specific helper app is required.
#
# == Security Tab ==
# Allow Virtual Machine: False
# Allow Screen Sharing / Display Mirroring: False
#
# == Keys Tab ==
# Enable Ctrl-N, Ctrl-T (New Window/Tab): False
# Enable Right Mouse Button: False (or True if your exam UI needs it for accessibility, but generally False)
# Enable Esc: False (During exam)
# Enable Function Keys (F1-F12): False
# Enable Ctrl-Alt-Del: False (SEB handles this for kiosk modes)
# Enable Alt-Tab / Cmd-Tab (Switch Applications): False
# Enable Alt-F4: False
# Enable PrintScreen key: False
# Enable Clipboard (Copy/Paste): False (Set `clipboardPolicy` to 2 for "Disable")
# Allowed Keyboard Keys: (This is tricky to define broadly, rely on SEB's process blocking. For specific input fields, JavaScript can filter, but SEB offers stronger control).
#   - If you want to restrict to A-Z, arrows, mouse only, this is usually done by a combination of disabling most function/modifier keys and potentially JavaScript on the page for specific inputs. Your provided XML has many `enableF_` keys set to false.
#
# == Exit Sequence Tab ==
# If "Allow user to quit SEB" is true, you can define an exit sequence (e.g., Ctrl+Q) or rely on the `seb://quit` link.
#
# This example .txt file is for guidance. Always use the SEB Configuration Tool to create the final .seb file.
# Test your .seb configuration thoroughly on all target operating systems.
# The exact key names and values might differ slightly between SEB versions and OS. Refer to official SEB documentation.
